# Employee and Assessment Management System Documentation
📌 This documentation provides a foundation for system operations. For advanced queries or custom reports, leverage SQL joins on the relational tables. 🚀
## 🌟 1. Overview
The system efficiently manages **employee data** and **performance assessments** through a relational database. It tracks:
- **Assessment periods** 📅
- **Evaluators (assessors)** 👨‍💼
- **Scores across multiple competency domains** 🏆
- **Summary report generation** 📊

---

## 🔗 2. Database Schema Overview
### **2.1 Core Tables**

#### 🏢 **Employees Table** (Stores employee profiles)
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  department VARCHAR(100),
  position VARCHAR(100),
  hire_date DATE
);
```

#### 📅 **Assessment Periods Table** (Defines evaluation cycles, e.g., "Q1 2025")
```sql
CREATE TABLE assessment_periods (
  period_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  period_name VARCHAR(100),
  start_date DATE,
  end_date DATE,
  status VARCHAR(20)
);
```

#### ✅ **Assessors Table** (Lists employees authorized to conduct assessments)
```sql
CREATE TABLE assessors (
  assessor_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_id INT,
  is_active TINYINT(1),
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id)
);
```

---

## 📜 3. Assessment Workflow
### **3.1 Assessment Criteria Tables**
Competency-based evaluations include:
- **Achievement Orientation** 🎯
- **Business Strategic Orientation** 📈

**Example Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE achievement_orientation (
  assessment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_id INT,
  period_id INT,
  assessor_id INT,
  looks_like_1 INT, -- Positive indicators
  doesnt_look_like_1 INT, -- Negative indicators
  comments TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (period_id) REFERENCES assessment_periods(period_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (assessor_id) REFERENCES assessors(assessor_id)
);
```

### **3.2 Rating Scale** 🎯
| Rating | Description              |
|--------|--------------------------|
| 1      | Poor Performance         |
| 2      | Needs Improvement        |
| 3      | Meets Expectations       |
| 4      | Exceeds Expectations     |
| 5      | Outstanding Performance  |

---

## 🔗 4. Key Relationships
### **4.1 Foreign Key Dependencies**
Assessments are linked to:
- **Employees (`employee_id`)** 👨‍💼
- **Assessment Periods (`period_id`)** 📆
- **Assessors (`assessor_id`)** ✅

### **4.2 Data Flow**
1. **An assessor** evaluates an employee within a defined **assessment period**.
2. Scores are stored in **competency-specific tables**.
3. The **assessment_summary table** aggregates the results:

```sql
CREATE TABLE assessment_summary (
  summary_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_id INT,
  period_id INT,
  total_score DECIMAL(5,2),
  average_score DECIMAL(5,2),
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (period_id) REFERENCES assessment_periods(period_id)
);
```

---

## 🔧 5. Example Operations
### **5.1 Adding a New Employee**
```sql
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, department, position, hire_date)
VALUES (101, 'John', 'Doe', 'Marketing', 'Manager', '2023-01-15');
```

### **5.2 Creating an Assessment Period**
```sql
INSERT INTO assessment_periods (period_id, period_name, start_date, end_date, status)
VALUES (1, 'Q1 2025', '2025-01-01', '2025-03-31', 'Active');
```

### **5.3 Conducting an Assessment**
```sql
-- Step 1: Assign assessor rights
INSERT INTO assessors (assessor_id, employee_id, is_active)
VALUES (501, 101, 1);

-- Step 2: Record scores for "Achievement Orientation"
INSERT INTO achievement_orientation (
  assessment_id, employee_id, period_id, assessor_id,
  looks_like_1, doesnt_look_like_1, comments
)
VALUES (
  1001, 101, 1, 501,
  4, 2, 'Consistently exceeds targets.'
);
```

### **5.4 Generating a Summary Report**
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, s.total_score, s.average_score
FROM assessment_summary s
JOIN employees e ON s.employee_id = e.employee_id
WHERE s.period_id = 1;
```

---

## 👥 6. User Management
### **6.1 Roles**
- **Admin**: Manages users and system settings (preconfigured).
- **Assessor**: Conducts evaluations (linked via assessors table).

### **6.2 Preconfigured Admin User**
```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, username, password, role)
VALUES (1, 'admin', 'hashed_password', 'admin');
```

---

## 🔒 7. Maintenance & Security
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign keys ensure valid references (e.g., no orphaned assessments).
- **Passwords**: Stored securely using hashing (e.g., `$2y$10$...` for bcrypt).

---

## ❓ 8. Troubleshooting
### **Issue: Cannot add an assessment.**
#### ✅ Solution:
- Ensure `employee_id` exists in `employees`.
- Confirm `period_id` is **active** in `assessment_periods`.
- Verify `assessor_id` is **marked active** in `assessors`.
